# Vite library mode commit-by-commit

This project is intended for demonstrating the config changes needed to turn a default Ember vite app into a universal library.

## How to use this project

The goal of this project is to import the ember app into the angular app, and render it there without any weird iframe tricks.

In order to simulate a "real" install from the npm registry, the angular app depends on the tarball of the ember project, as generated by the standard `pnpm pack` command.

Start at step 1, and run `pnpm install`.

For each commit in the chain, you can run `pnpm build` in the workspace root to execute a build-pack-install cycle, and then run `pnpm start` to start the angular app.

At some stages, this will intentionally crash or not work properly, in order to demonstrate the problems as we go through each of the required changes step by step.

# Step 1: The beginning

We start with the initial setup: both apps are cleanly generated from their respective CLIs. Run `pnpm install`, followed by `pnpm start` to make sure everything works correctly. The default angular app should start.
